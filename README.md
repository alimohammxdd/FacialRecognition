Facial Recognition Using OpenCV
In this project we will detect faces and store them then we will train and test the dataset
If the face is found it will return the name that was written when it was detected else it'll return UNKNOWN.

You have to first install facial recognition library and OpenCV 
then you have to run create a file in the this same folder that with the name DS
then run the dc file
it will ask you to input your id (make sure you're writing the 1st id as 1 and then so on ) and will ask for ur camera access then
run the train file and before running the test file you've to write the name of the ids 
it have to be in the order youve stored the dataset
