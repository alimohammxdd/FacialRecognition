Facial Recognition Using OpenCV

In this project we will detect faces and store them then we will train and test the dataset

If the face is found it will return the name that was written when it was detected else it'll return UNKNOWN.

You have to first install facial recognition library and OpenCV.
Then you have to create a file in this same folder with the name DS.
Next you have to run the dc file.
It will ask you to input your id (make sure you're writing the 1st id as 1 and then so on ) and will ask for ur camera access. Now you have to run the train file and before running the test file you've to write the name of the ids, It has to be in the order you've stored the dataset
